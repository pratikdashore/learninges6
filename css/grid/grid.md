# GRID:: for 2 dimentional layout

## MDN CSS (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids)

## fr unit is for flexible size for grid rows and column, it represents fraction of available space in grid container 

### Note: The fr unit distributes available space, not all space. Therefore, if one of your tracks has something large inside it, there will be less free space to share.


## The rules for grid-template-areas are as follows:

* You need to have every cell of the grid filled.
* To span across two cells, repeat the name.
* To leave a cell empty, use a . (period).
* Areas must be rectangular â€” for example, you can't have an L-shaped area.
* Areas can't be repeated in different locations.
